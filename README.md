This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).



## What?

A "Perplexity-like" search UI using streaming RSC via the Vercel AI SDK. OpenAI's ChatGPT is used kind of as a router via function calling to render the UI that matches the search query (weather and text).
